<h1>STOPP-/START Criteria v2 Implementations</h1>
<p>Huibers et al. (2018, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.12.010">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.12.010</a>) is the first study providing implementable algorithms for software applications based on STOPP/START version 2, validated in a computer decision support system. These algorithms can serve as a template for applying STOPP/START criteria version 2 to any software application, allowing for adaptations of the included ICD, ICPC and ATC codes and changing the cut-off levels for laboratory measurements to match local guidelines or clinical expertise.</p>
<p>This repository makes available the original algorithms in machine-readable formats, and strives to maintain a list of open source implementations of them.</p>
<p>Currently, this repository contains the following data:</p>
