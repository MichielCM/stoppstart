<h1>STOPP/START v2 Algorithms in XML</h1>
<p>The core data files developed with Huibers et al. (2018) are presented here in XML format. The distribution consists of two files:</p>
<ol>
  <li>stoppstart.xsd: an XML schema file describing the structure of stoppstart.xml;</li>
  <li>stoppstart.xml: an XML file containing, in a structure described by stoppstart.xsd, the STOPP-/START version 2 algorithms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional documentation on using these files can be found in the appendices (supplementary material) to Huibers et al. (2018).</p>
<p>Please note that these files are licensed under the LGPL v3 license. This means, in summary, that they can be used freely in any implementation (open source or otherwise), provided that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>any modifications (e.g. bugfixes or additions) to the data are shared with the community; this excludes code not derived from these data files;</li>
  <li>implementations should be able to use any future version of these data files without modification; this ensures that future data updates and additions quickly find their way to users.</li>
</ol>
